An offline signature verification system that classifies signatures to either original or forged using a Convolutinal Neural Network model as a classifier. The offline signature verification process is formed of three main stages: preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. In the preprocessing stage, the images are prepared using a thresholding method in addition to some scaling operations including pixel normalization and image resizing to make the images ready for the next stages. The approach leverages the powerful feature extraction capabilities of CNNs to distinguish between genuine and forged signatures. The CNN model was trained and tested on a Cedar dataset which includes 2640 signature images of 55 individuals, each individual has 24 genuine and 24 forged signatures.  The classification system is a writer_Independent system. The CNN classification model achieves an accuracy of 87%.
